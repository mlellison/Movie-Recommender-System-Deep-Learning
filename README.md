# Movie-Recommender-System-Deep-Learning

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) What was the problem?

Built a RecSys based on movielens dataset in order to recommend movie to users with content based filtering

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.) How to solve them?

Used Matrix Factorization and TF-IDF for RecSys model, recommendation are based on user ratings or term frequency
Built a web app with streamlit to capture user inputs for recommendation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.) What was the outcome?

The outcome is based on correlation score or similarity score, user search for a movie, then output 10 recommended movies
For example, searching Ex Machina, will recommend AI or robotic movies like Chappie, AlphaGo, etc
